-- PROBLEM 1
-- Find the last element of a list.
last' :: [a] -> a
last' [] = error "empty list"
last' [x] = x
last' (x:xs) = last xs

-- PROBLEM 2
-- Find the last but one element of a list.
lastButOne :: [a] -> a
lastButOne [] = error "empty list"
lastButOne [x] = error "list has only one element"
lastButOne [x,y] = x
lastButOne (x:xs) = lastButOne xs

-- PROBLEM 3
-- Find the Kth element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.
elementAt :: [a] -> Int -> a
elementAt [] n = error "index out of range"
elementAt (x:xs) n
  | n == 1 = x
  | otherwise = elementAt xs (n-1)

-- PROBLEM 4
--  Find the number of elements in a list.
length' :: [a] -> Int
length' [] = 0
length' (x:xs) = 1 + length xs

-- PROBLEM 5
-- Reverse a list.
reverse' :: [a] -> [a]
reverse' [] = []
reverse' (x:xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]

-- PROBLEM 6
-- Find out whether a list is a palindrome.
isPalindrome :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Bool
isPalindrome [] = True
isPalindrome [x] = True
isPalindrome (x:xs) = x == last xs && isPalindrome (init xs)

-- PROBLEM 7
-- Flatten a nested list structure.
data NestedList a = Elem a | List [NestedList a]
flatten :: NestedList a -> [a]
flatten (Elem x) = [x]
flatten (List []) = []
flatten (List (x:xs)) = flatten x ++ flatten (List xs)


-- PROBLEM 8
-- Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.
compress :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a]
compress [] = []
compress [x] = [x]
compress (x:xs)
  | x == head xs = compress xs
  | otherwise = x:compress xs

-- PROBLEM 9
-- Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists. If a list
-- contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate sublists.
-- Ex. pack [1,1,2,2,3,3,4] = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4]]
pack :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]]
pack [] = []
pack [x] = [[x]]
pack (x:xs)
  | x == (head (head (pack xs))) = (x:(head (pack xs))):(tail (pack xs))
  | otherwise = [x]:(pack xs)

-- PROBLEM 10
-- Implement the run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive
-- duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the
-- number of duplicates of the element E.
-- Ex. encode [1,1,1,2,2,2,3] = [(3,1),(3,2),(1,3)]
encode :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [(Int,a)]
encode [] = []
encode [x] = [(1,x)]
encode (x:xs)
  | x == b    = (a+1,x):(tail (encode xs))
  | otherwise = (1,x):(encode xs)
  where (a,b) = head (encode xs)
  
-- PROBLEM 11
-- Modify PROBLEM 10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates
-- it is simply copied into the result list. Only elements with duplicates
-- are transferred as (N E) lists.
-- Ex. encode-modified [1,1,2,3,3,3] =
--  [Multiple 2 1, Single 2, Multiple 3,3]
